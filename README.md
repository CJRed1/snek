# snek and snak

Building a version of the snake game in Python and Pygame.

:snake: :apple: *snek and snak* is a simple game where if snek eats a
snak it gets longer and your score increases. If your snek hits any part of
its body it will die. The user controls the direction of the snek's head (up, down,
left or right) with the arrow keys and the snekÂ´s body follows. Also, the player
can't stop the movement of the snek while the game is running.

Below are some images about the current state of the game, which **is still under
construction** :point_down:
